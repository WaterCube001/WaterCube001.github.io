Say hello here! My name is Miao Sun. I am currently a PhD student in the [School of Microelectronics at Fudan University](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), pursuing a five-year program. I am expected to obtain my doctoral degree in June 2023. My advisor is [Prof. Patrick Yin Chiang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/5f/e4/c31146a352228/page.htm) and my research focuses on chip and system design based on SPAD (Single-Photon Avalanche Diode) and depth completion technology. I am looking for some potential postdoctoral positions, mainly focused on digital system design, digital processing and applications of near-sensor end. I am a chip guy, designing much cooler chips, and working with excellent ICers are ideal goals for me now!


Academic Biography
======
During her doctoral studies, Miao Sun specialized in the design and implementation of a dedicated accelerator chip for deep sensor imaging algorithms. As the first author, she completed the design of a dToF (direct time-of-flight) depth completion accelerator and successfully fabricated and verified it through the 40nm process technology of SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation). The corresponding research results were published on TCAS-II. The chip is capable of completing sparse 32x32 point cloud images into 640x480 depth images, accelerating the post-processing part of algorithms by implementing a RISC-V with a vector processor. It is currently the only hardware acceleration work in the field of depth completion, providing practical solutions for the implementation and deployment of LiDAR automatic driving. This work has received unanimous recommendations from reviewers. In addition, a single-point imaging system based on dToF was proposed, which used monocular depth imaging algorithms based on RGB images to accurately recover depth images from the full histogram generated by the depth sensor. This is currently the only optical system for single-point depth sensor imaging.
